This solution is made from scratch by myself and not copied in any projects or so. All needed materials to run this on a localhost are in this repository.

Approach and Solution:

I alloted 15hrs total for the development and 2hours for the logical thinking before starting the development.
This Weather App, is made of PHP, HTML, CSS ,JQUERY, AJAX and MYSQL and XAMPP for the apache to sum up the tools I used to develop this test.
I used the AccuWeather API as instructed, to gather the needed data for the displaying of the weather forecast.

I have made a modal with a function to add your own API Key, you may select the API Keys you want to use for this application.
(Invalid API keys will result in an error which will show if you check the weather forecast button)
You can also add a Location in which city you want to check the weather forecast and set it up.
Changing API Key and Location Key doesn't required to click a button as it is using on change ajax function.

Note:
To run in localhost, kindly import the sql file in the database folder inorder for the app to properly run and execute its functions.
